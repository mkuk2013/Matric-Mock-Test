    "englishPassage": "In ancient times, storytelling was not only a form of entertainment but also a means of preserving culture and history. People gathered around fires, in courtyards, or under the open sky to listen to elders tell stories of bravery, wisdom, love, and morality. These stories often contained deep lessons and were passed from generation to generation through word of mouth. Storytellers used dramatic voices, gestures, and sometimes musical instruments to keep their audience engaged. Their words painted vivid pictures in the minds of the listeners, allowing them to imagine distant lands, heroes, mythical creatures, and life lessons. However, with the advent of modern technology, the tradition of oral storytelling has declined. Television, internet, and mobile phones have taken the place once held by the storyteller. Now, people rarely have time to sit and listen. Despite this, storytelling still holds a special place in education and literature. Teachers use stories to explain complex topics, and authors use them to entertain and inspire readers. The value of a good story remains, even though the way we tell and listen to stories has changed."

      "question": "Passage: The most important features of the Indus Valley civilization are town planning and architecture. The cities of the Indus Valley civilization were very well planned. Each city was planned in a grid-like pattern, formed by straight roads running from North to South and East to West. This divided the city into blocks. The main streets were ten (10) meters wide, so two bullock carts could pass by each other. The houses were built of thick walls of baked bricks. The bricks were joined together with mud, gypsum and lime mortar. The architecture of the Indus civilization was very advanced. There were well-designed dockyards, well-built granaries, large warehouses, well-aligned brick platforms and impenetrable protective walls. The massive walls of Indus cities most likely protected them from floods and invaders."
